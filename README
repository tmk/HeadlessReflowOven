Headless Reflow Oven Controller
===============================
Simple reflow oven controller just with button, buzzer and LED, no LCD.


This is based on work of ohararp ReflowOven,
  https://github.com/ohararp/ReflowOven

which is modification of rocketscream Reflow-Oven-Controller.

Requirements
------------
Arduino board
  Duemialanove or any

Solid State Relay
  Fotek SSR-40-DA

MAX31855 and Thermocouple-K

Tactile Switch

Piezzo Buzzer

LED


MAX31855 memo
-------------
Without capacitor between terminals of thermocouple it indicates lower temperature by around 10 deg, too fast read to charge sample capacitor of the chip? With 0.1uF the temperature looks good but change is slow, too big capacitance?  Shoud try 0.01uF instead.
