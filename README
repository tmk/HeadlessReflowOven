Headless Reflow Oven Controller
===============================
Simple reflow oven controller just with button, buzzer and LED, no LCD.


This is based on work of ohararp ReflowOven,
  https://github.com/ohararp/ReflowOven

which is modification of rocketscream Reflow-Oven-Controller.

Requirements
------------
Arduino board
  Duemialanove or any

Solid State Relay
  Fotek SSR-40-DA

MAX31855 and Thermocouple-K
  https://learn.adafruit.com/thermocouple/overview
  https://www.adafruit.com/products/269

Tactile Switch

Piezzo Buzzer

LED


MAX31855 memo
-------------
Without capacitor between terminals of thermocouple it indicates lower temperature by around 10 deg, too fast read to charge sample capacitor of the chip? With 0.1uF the temperature looks good but change is slow, too big capacitance?  Shoud try 0.01uF instead.

Reset by connected with terminal
--------------------------------
It is not desirable particularly after it starts reflow. To avoid the reset see this page.
120Ohm method didn't work for my Duemilanove but `stty /dev/ttySUB0 -hupcl` works on Linux.

Build with ino tool
-------------------

    $ ino build
    $ ino upload

or

    $ avrdude -P/dev/ttyUSB0  -pm168 -c arduino -b19200 -U flash:w:.build/diecimila_atmega168/firmware

http://inotool.org/quickstart
http://inotool.org/

2018/07/03 ino doesn't work for no reason now. Use arduino command line instead.


Build wit arduino command line
------------------------------
You will need to install follwing libraries under ~/Arduino/libraries to build.

- PID_v1
- Adafruit-MAX31855-library

See this doc for options.

https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/master/build/shared/manpage.adoc

    $ arduino --upload --pref build.path=./build-cli --board arduino:avr:diecimila -v --port /dev/ttyUSB0 src/HeadlessReflowOven.ino
